Bumps `@guardian/support-dotcom-components` to `v2.0.1`.
This is a major change [as per our recommendations](https://github.com/guardian/recommendations/blob/main/npm-packages.md#changes-to-peerdependencies-ranges-are-breaking), and consumers should
ensure that they provide a compatible version of the package.
