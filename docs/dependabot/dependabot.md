# Dependabot

We use [Dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/) to keep our dependencies up to date.

## dependamerge.sh

Located in the `/scripts` folder, this will combine all open dependabot branches into one branch, making it easy for us to create a PR from all outstanding dependabot updates.
